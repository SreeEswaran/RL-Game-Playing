# RL-Game-Playing
# Reinforcement Learning for Game Playing

This project demonstrates the use of reinforcement learning to train an agent to play a simple game using the Q-learning algorithm.

## Project Structure

- `environment.py`: Defines the game environment.
- `agent.py`: Defines the reinforcement learning agent.
- `train.py`: Script to train the agent.
- `play.py`: Script to test the trained agent.
- `results/`: Directory to store trained models and training logs.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required packages.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SreeEswaran/RL-Game-Playing.git
    cd RL-Game-Playing
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Training the Agent
To train the agent, run:
```bash
python train.py
